        p Nestflix is a wiki dressed up as pretend streaming platform that catalogs fictional films and tv shows inside real movies and tv shows.
        p Is your fave nested film or show missing from this site?

        p You might be wondering where #[em Rochelle, Rochelle] from #[em Seinfeld] is. Or #[em Coming Home in a Body Bag] from #[em True Romance].
        p Hereâ€™s the criteria for what gets added:
        ul
            li Must be fictional (not just a recreation of a real film)
            li Must show actual footage (not just mentioned in dialogue or seen in a poster)
            li Is not a news or morning news show (for now, this might change)
        p If you have one to add, please #[a(href='') create an issue on GitHub] or fill out this handy form:
        p TODO: add Netlify form
